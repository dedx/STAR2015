# STAR 2015 Opening Conference

##Coding in the Classroom

**Jennifer Klay**
California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo

**Description:**
Coding and computer programming are essential skills for 21st century learners but how can we provide opportunities to build such skills in the classroom?  Open source tools and programming languages with simple and natural syntax provide one avenue.  In this workshop I will introduce participants to the Python programming language using the IPython/Jupyter notebook.  I will present ways to help students learn to practice algorithmic thinking, to work together to problem solve, and to apply the computer to solve problems that interest them.  In addition, a variety of useful resources for developing lessons and integrating coding into existing curricula will be discussed.

**Audience:**  Aspiring or early-career K-12 STEM teachers hoping to include research/computing in the classroom.

**Assumed programming experience:**  None
